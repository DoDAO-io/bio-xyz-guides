      Decentralization refers to the process of transferring and maintaining
      control and decision-making from a centralized entity to a distributed
      network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that
      participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert
      authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the
      functionality of the network in favor of special interests. Decentralized
      networks are designed to be more resistant to corruption and interference,
      and to provide better service overall. However, decentralization has some
      tradeoffs, such as lower transaction throughput due to less personalized
      decision structures. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to
      decentralize a network depends on whether the tradeoffs are worth the
      improved stability and service levels that decentralization can provide.



      **Benefits of Decentralization**


      There are several benefits to decentralization, including providing a
      trustless environment, improving data reconciliation, reducing points of
      weakness, and optimizing incentive distribution:

      A decentralized system provides a trustless environment because each
      member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a
      distributed ledger. If a member’s ledger is altered or corrupted in any
      way, it will be rejected by the majority of the members in the network.
      Decentralization benefits can be also attributed to data reconciliation.
      Companies often exchange data with their partners. This data, in turn, is
      typically transformed and stored in each party’s data silos, only to
      resurface when it needs to be passed downstream. By having a decentralized
      database, every entity has access to a real-time, shared view of the data.
      Decentralization can also reduce points of weakness in systems where there
      may be too much reliance on specific actors. These weak points could lead
      to systemic failures, including failure to provide promised services or
      inefficient service due to the exhaustion of resources, periodic outages,
      bottlenecks, lack of sufficient incentives for good service, or
      corruption. Finally, decentralization can help optimize the distribution
      of resources so that promised services are provided with better
      performance and consistency, as well as a reduced likelihood of
      catastrophic failure. Decentralization of workflows and actors can help to
      enable an efficient use of resources and talent without creating
      capital-intense redundancies as a result of frictionless access and
      interaction of infrastructure and talent.



      **Drawbacks of Decentralization**


      Despite the described benefits, there are a few downsides to
      decentralization:

      It can lead to duplication of effort and confusion if there is not a clear
      leader or decision maker. It can be difficult to coordinate and
      communicate between different decentralized units. New members are often
      required to take initiative to create value rather than receive clear
      directives. It can be less time-efficient than centralized decision
      making, since decisions have to be made by consensus.

      A blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions, paid for with
      cryptocurrency. It is a constantly growing database as blocks are
      finalized with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and all new
      transaction data since the previous block.

      For example, Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to differentiate legitimate
      Bitcoin transactions from attempts to double-spend coins that have already
      been spent elsewhere. 


      **Ethereum**


      Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that runs smart contracts:
      applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of
      fraud or third party interference.

      Ethereum is used as a "world computer" whereby developers can create
      decentralized applications (dapps) and run them on the Ethereum network.
      This is possible because Ethereum has a native programming language, which
      allows developers to create their own smart contracts and dapps.

      The Ethereum network is powered by ether, a cryptocurrency spent to run
      transactions and dapps on the network. When a user wants to run a
      transaction or dapp, they must first pay a gas fee in ether. The fee goes
      to the miners who validate and execute the transactions and dapps on the
      network, ensuring its security.


      **Web3**


      Web3 is an idea for a new version of the internet which would be more
      decentralized than the current version. The term was coined in 2014 by
      Gavin Wood, and has gained interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large
      tech companies, and venture capitalists in 2021. Some argue that Web3
      would provide increased data security, privacy, and individual
      sovereignty.

      Web3 refers to the next generation of the web's infrastructure, which is
      based on decentralization and incorporates blockchain technologies as
      cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The intention is to make
      the web more secure and allow users to have more control over their data.
      Technology scholars have argued that Web3 will likely run in tandem with
      existing web sites, with the latter adopting Web3 technologies in order to
      stay relevant.
