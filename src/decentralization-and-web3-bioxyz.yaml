      Decentralization refers to the process of transferring and maintaining
      control and decision-making from a centralized entity to a distributed
      network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that
      participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert
      authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the
      functionality of the network in favor of special interests. Decentralized
      networks are designed to be more resistant to corruption and interference,
      and to provide better service overall. However, decentralization has some
      tradeoffs, such as lower transaction throughput due to less personalized
      decision structures. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to
      decentralize a network depends on whether the tradeoffs are worth the
      improved stability and service levels that decentralization can provide.
